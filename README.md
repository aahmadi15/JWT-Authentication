This project was done for exploratory purposes to refine and get better with Node JS.  By no means is it complete - In fact you will find errors on runtime due to the app.post('/login) route and issues with the accessToken that is to be generated.  

This project is strictly done to measure progress.

UPDATE 2026-01-11

I've since updated this program and it retains functionality on the backend with react implementation.  It gets to the login screen and will authenticate via Node JS - that's as far as I've reached so far.  I may come back to finish and implement a registration page with a welcome screen on successful login.

UPDATE 2026-02-15

I've since added proper login - access token functionality, authentication, registration.  Will focus more on the JWT side of things now adding refresh token and a forgot password functionality - hope to add proper middleware rather than just dumping all on index.js
